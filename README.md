# flutter-transparency

Experiments with transparent Flutter views over native activities (Android) and native views (iOS).

Many things work out of the box just by following Flutter's tutorial ([link for Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/android/add-flutter-screen) and [link for iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/ios/add-flutter-screen)), but I've been having trouble with transitions and the status bar in Android.
